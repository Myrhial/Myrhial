## ⚡ Fun Fact
**Did you know that cats often "debug" their paths before moving forward?** Before jumping onto a surface or squeezing into a tight space, they do small calculations—assessing height, depth, and landing stability. Kind of like how developers debug their code before pushing it live! 🐱💻
